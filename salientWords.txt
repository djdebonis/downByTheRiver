zipping along 55 suddenly entire van three large skips way tube hops three huge waves towed
third skip van completely jumped air upon landing right fender scraped along pavement
initially stunned began laugh maniacally given scare

later walked outside freezing cold high elevation air looked millions diamonds sparkling across dark night sky
stood neck awkwardly bent amazement finally caught comet shooting across sky
cast wish said bolide imagined wish taking hold flying star like fishhook pulled galaxy galaxy await final judgement cosmos

pavement passed beneath rubber wheels head constantly filled new thoughts write
wonder laws writing driving

afternoon sun fell orange across western horizon stayed put rest stop watching hundreds people come go
initially left home escape

sun set went driving find place sleep
barebacked crossing dark night windows radio going

blink eye illusion whisped away misty dusk
alone sitting darkness beneath buzzing yellow park light
see never alone
lethargic cloud blankeded northwest made dilusional blinded wandering aimlessly harsh realities life road
sure image real promise keep merely sake words
everything seemed smoldering away
stripped naked walked reserivoir broken dreams
moon burning blood orange round full ominious foggy lake
sky black stars dissapated fallen straight space
took breath thin polluted air filled lungs fast hardly gave life
beneath cool water floated weightlessly sandy bottom trying escape phantom night
traveler lonesome one
expedition sake saving soul would boil away flame
although many meet see journey reserved road
end alone floating beneath darkness water
although may meet along river current take us sea
looked pitch black sky
directly horizon grand prism covered sun light beamed behind edges like rays fire
prism completely eclipsed sun
essence moon shone infinitely black like void space
land upon earth dark gray wasteland shadows sillouettes
looked father jonathan john stood front left
horrible way end said

want leave legacy want words tracks leave upon human experience
within tales fade away inevitable decay
tattered shoes faded shirts press without coats help us bare winter storm
whether gas floor bourbon tounges headlights glaring windshield shaky fingers held steadfast keyboard scent cigarettes coffee cologne press
broken hearts nostalgic guitar melodies bedroom rainy summer day press
carve initials aspen groves cast wishes across tails shooting stars searching answers infinite infinite answer press

09 03 2017 david j debonis gifford pinchot national forest washington arrived woods wednesday night dusk
small space squeezed dense green forest
ferns coated ground wander anywhere without hip deep brush
everywhere looked eerie moss coating dirt trees rocks
began feel claustrophobic paired realization absolutely alone
one miles direction tucked deeply woods doubted anyone could find tried
sensations crept chest experiencing utter sense doom
felt panic strike againshakes heart flutters adrenaline dumpsthe whole nine
stood chair began pace anxiously tire track trail
quickly turned back
knows woods
returned campsight stiffly plopped chair
decided time open envelope ap literature teacher sent
instructed open time feeling lonely far home entered next stage life
inside envelope folded excerpt letters young poet rainer maria rilke yellow printer paper
type hand written note blue pen read everything need inside dj
miles read excerpt calmed enough focus trying say
astounded relevant current situation
folded paper back tucked book followed instructions wrote patience everything unresolved heart love solitude try sing pain causes rilke
although still felt lonely stressed perspective whole situation changed felt tremendously better
sat back van reflected breathed fell restless slumber chopped dreams
next morning woke sun already high left cramped camp sight search cell service could call good friend david planned
time left realized hour late accounted time change
zoomed along forest road trying make nearest town 2pm
first miles road smooth paved like two lane highway
zipping along 55 suddenly entire van three large skips way tube hops three huge waves towed boat
third skip van completely jumped air upon landing right fender scraped along pavement
initially stunned began laugh maniacally given scare
next fifty miles extremely rough winding along wavy cracked paved road
time finally reached packwood small town expected find service fill ice realized still absolutely cell service figured would throw towel left national forest
quick stop ranger station random wandering found spectacular camp sight bridge across butter creek
spot high bank although still deep woods felt much breathable previous night
sat afternoon feeling lonely anxious
watched river go overwhelmed nostalgia
began thinking denver friends family memories shared
concluded denver would always home wrote letters put thoughts page
spent three nights days camped along butter creek
constant flow crystal clear water seemed carry consistent surge memories mind
smelled ground folgers coffee beans big red brought back home
percolator bubbled propane stove thought sitting around table command post elk camp
jotted journal butter creek sunshine ripples upon mossy oak trees river bank butter creek speaks beautiful rhythm tone life around crystal clear water carries memories spoken song bottom image every stone glass current riverside alive among green leaves breathes sees much whilst alone woods
spent time studying books observing environment
started feel like old manager good friend brian currently reading seven eight books couple writing textbooks spiritual text fiction novel book poems non fiction compilations
never understand juggled one time think starting get idea
much easier focus reading source entertainment
without cell service television even someone talk difficult spend half daylight hours reading
reading tried focus environment become conscious mind world around
two major states found whilst alone wilderness
first loud conversation thoughts within head
state similar someone talking without spoken word
although nothing actually said constant flow loud passionate distracting thoughts surging mind
state effective useful creative standpoint causes one become absorbed head lose touch environment reality exists present moment
hand would also find mind place complete silence
state think manner language instead rely solely intuitive thought
still capable actingcompleting everyday tasks words reflecting mind action
previously mentioned stream consciousness finally settles become aware far
mean although body walking along trail mind somewhere else nearly oblivious actually going moment
meditative state allows one connect present moment therefore become touch nature
state thought feel similar deer
develop heightened sense awareness become one forest opposed someone merely passing
experience seen closely related taoist perception yin yang taoism yang described expansion yin described concentration
tao te ching lao tzu says yang expansion state human mind produces ideas creates driven passion
state mind understand effects principle aka tao cannot know principle
hand yin state mind empty calm completely still
state practitioner knows mysterious essences principle tao
practitioner sage aims find balance two equilibrium
described well known yin yang symbol tzu
final description use symbol water describe events
state expansion consistently thinking talking within head seen ocean
ocean currents powerful strong tide constantly moves waves constantly crash along shore
powerful force movements also jagged unpredictable
therefore ocean constant state unrest
state concentration calm meditative silence much like high mountain pond
still silent move unless rippled stone gust wind
pond rest peace also seem get anywhere
leaves us rivers streams connect two
rivers constant motion go flow land
stick falls river picks takes along
boulder falls river simply flows around
river calm peaceful also powerful strong
flows high point still concentration large pool passionate powerful expansion cycles sky goes back
sense seen river balance practitioner strives
see rambling lone writer tends
anyway spent time studying magical mysteries earth gifted us moon river sun stars order better understand spiritual happenings spawned life
still far understanding passionately discovering every day
anyway end first expedition woods felt touch wilderness nature general
reach clock
spent entirety everyday outside morning dew sun set woods twilight blue beneath moonlight
workouts using ground rocks bodyweight top bathed crystal clear creek
wrote journal clean clear headed revitalized end driven infestation little black skeeters
sudden ground river entire body
reason believe biting left break dawn morning
figure universe telling time moving
sun slowly rose gifford pinchot forest wove mountains dim gray light
carved way valley ultimately paralleling large river assume butter creek feeds
river rolled along side side began smell thick scent wildfire
aroma always makes sad smells heartwarming yet know somewhere forest burning
guess way goes
sat outside small espresso shop small city washington watched sun climb horizon like orange globe smoky haze blanketed city wrote post

writer begin feel like driving coffee shop coffee shop struggling detail everything happens
although enjoy writing posts know helpful later merely blossoms fruits writing hope cultivate adventure
much morning coffee shop
yet another coffee shop drinking large black coffee trying make happened since left yakima however long ago
journal stained coffee memory feels like wildfire air spent week trucking smokestack forests towns northwest like foggy dream
blasted across washington towards idaho tractors drove across burning yellow prairies kicking dust white gray sky
hay cut bailed farmers made preparations coming winter months
drowsy glazed eyes gazed upon interstate roaring bug splattered windshield drove along watched small dirt roads branch highway disappear fog wondering go
lanes rolled head constantly filled thoughts ideas like flow river
write without flying oncoming semi trucks wondered laws writing driving
came idaho drowsy haze suddenly became denser gray silhouettes mysterious pines lined northbound road
crossed large reservoir felt like driving across highway skystraight dense clouds
landed night beside lake sandy point idaho
came across kids boxing beach park taught youngest one basic set skills
chatted fellas soon floated thick fog alone sand

life ever changing road
09 03 2017 david j debonis arrived woods wednesday night dusk
small space squeezed dense green forest
ferns coated ground wander anywhere without hip deep brush
everywhere looked eerie moss coating dirt trees rocks
began feel claustrophobic paired realization absolutely alone
one miles direction tucked deeply woods doubted anyone could find tried
sensations creeped chest experiencing utter sense doom
anxious lonely tired long hot day road
decided time open envelope ap literature teacher sent
instructed open time feeling lonely entered next stage life
inside envelope folded excerpt letters young poet rainer maria rilke yellow printer paper
type hand written note blue pen read everything need inside dj
miles read excerpt calmed enough focus trying say
astounded relevant current situation
folded paper back tucked book followed instructions wrote patience everything unresolved heart love solitude try sing pain causes although still felt lonely perspective whole situation changed felt tremendously better
sat back van reflected breathed fell restless slumber chopped dreams
next morning woke sun already high left cramped camp sight search cell service could call good friend david planned
time left realized hour late accounted time change
zoomed along forest road trying make nearest town 2pm
first miles road smooth paved like two lane highway
zipping along 55 suddenly entire van three large skips way tube hops three huge waves towed
third skip van completely jumped air upon landing right fender scraped along pavement
initially stunned began laugh maniacally given scare
next fifty miles extremely rough winding along wavy cracked paved road
listened tunes bop skipidee doo
time finally reached packwood realized still absolutely cell service figured would throw towel left national forest
found spectacular camp sight bridge across butter creek
spot high bank although still deep woods felt much breathable previous night
sat afternoon feeling lonely anxious
watched river go overwhelmed nostalgia
began thinking denver friends family memories shared
concluded denver would always home wrote letters put thoughts page
spent three nights days camped along butter creek
constant flow crystal clear water seemed carry consistent surge memories mind
smelled ground folgers coffee beans big red brought back home
percolator bubbled propane stove thought sitting around table command post elk camp
jotted journal butter creek sunshine ripples upon mossy oak trees river bank butter creek speaks beautiful rhythm tone life around crystal clear water carries memories spoken song bottom image every stone glass current riverside alive among green leaves breathes sees much whilst alone woods
spent time studying books observing environment
started feel like old manager good friend brian currently reading seven eight books couple writing textbooks spiritual text fiction novel book poems non fiction compilations
never understand juggled one time think starting get idea
much easier focus reading source entertainment
without cell service television even someone talk difficult spend half daylight hours reading
reading tried focus environmentto become conscious mind world around
two major states found whilst alone wilderness
first loud conversation thoughts within head
state similar someone talking without spoken word
although nothing actually said constant flow loud passionate distracting thoughts surging mind
state effective useful creative standpoint causes one become absorbed head therefore lose touch environment reality exists present moment
hand also find mind place complete silence
state think manner language instead rely solely intuitive thought
still capable actingcompleting everyday tasks words reflecting mind action
previously mentioned stream consciousness finally settles become aware far
mean although body walking along trail mind somewhere else nearly oblivious actually going moment
meditative state allows one connect present moment therefore become touch nature
state thought feel similar deer
develop heightened sense awareness become one forest opposed someone merely passing
experience seen closely related taoist perception yin yang taoism yang described expansion yin described concentration
tao te ching lao tzu says yang expansion state human mind produces ideas creates driven passion
state mind understand effects principle aka tao cannot know principle
hand yin state mind empty calm completely still
state practitioner knows mysterious essences principle tao
practitioner sage aims find balance two equilibrium
described well known yin yang symbol
final description use symbol water describe events
state expansion consistently thinking talking within head seen ocean
ocean currents powerful strong tide constantly moves waves constantly crash along shore
powerful force movements also jagged unpredictable
therefore ocean constant state unrest
state concentration calm meditative silence much like high mountain pond
still silent move unless rippled stone gust wind
pond rest peace also seem get anywhere
leaves us rivers streams connect two
rivers constant motion go flow land
stick falls river picks takes along
boulder falls river simply flows around
river calm peaceful also powerful strong
flows high point still concentration large pool passion power cycles sky goes back
sense seen river balance practitioner strives
see rambling lone writer tends
anyway spent time studying magical mysteries earth gifted us moon river sun stars order better understand spiritual happenings spawned life
still far understanding passionately discovering everyday
anyway end first expedition woods felt touch wilderness nature general
reach time
spent entirety everyday outside morning dew sun set woods twilight blue moonlight
workouts using ground rocks bodyweight top bathed crystal clear river
wrote journal clean clear headed revitalized end driven infestation little black skeeters
sudden ground river entire body
reason believe biting left break dawn morning
figure universe telling time moving
sun slowly rose gifford pinchot forrest wove mountains dim gray light
carved way valley ultimately paralleling large river assume butter creek feeds
river rolled along side side began smell thick scent wildfire
aroma always makes sad smells heartwarming yet know somewhere forest burning
guess way goes
sat outside small espresso shop small city washington watched sun climb horizon like orange globe smoky haze blanketed city wrote post
present moment something known understanding word
experienced firsthand
therefore seen word actually obstructs essence present moment theory applied language lost track time ago
know sun rises sets
mean say sense time implying still check watch
mean say first time remember since childhood form schedule
eat hungry sleep tired please everywhere
living road opens lot freedom hard find modern world
freedom comes certain level responsibility stress
unless wilderness hard find place cook
traveler budget eating cannot become daily routine
often times eat small snack pre cooked food eat
also always know sleeping somewhere sleep
many places living van highly frowned upon may mean receive little sleep night
yesterday came back van parked blocks beachwhere thought would staying nightand came across sign stuck window read overnight parking call police ended finding much better place sleep could relax outside van sleep late needed talk people along beach
place called fiesta island although technically illegal park overnight become safe sd area van dwellers rv travelers homeless people alike
found things tendency work especially faith idea
08 06 2017 david j debonis mentioned getting bored merely summarizing travels
caused certain degree writers block posted anything weeks
order revamp inspiration blog posts going alter focus writing
also attached poems bottom
poetry freeing medium writing say lot small amount word space
poems listed help contribute feelings subject
absolutely adore fall
always large range reasons
starters time summer winding end generally pretty fed heat sun
must side effect colorado condition born snow child always one
year experienced heat like never
spent first months summer working 40 50 hour weeks washing cars beneath colorado 300 days sun time done work arms hide dyed orange brown quite tired sweating
setting road offered relief burning summer exposure
matter fact got worse
embarked road straight high desertliving van air conditioning middle august
point beads sweat forehead stuck like glue dream anything 12 inch snow storm
next month half stuck perpetual state overheating finally made montana snowed september
changing seasons relief heat
beautiful time year weather fine crops harvested leaves change culture heart warming
always enjoyed little things like overlooking field yellow trees enjoying comfortable sweater weather even sitting around family sunday afternoon watch broncos game always brought sense contentment
far intriguing aspect fall symbolism provides universe whole
read writing regularly generally point begin ramblings cosmic happenings
universe know moves cycles
four seasons cycle
moon revolves around earth cycles
earth revolves around sun cycles
tide moves cycles even us humans lead lives cycles
would classify cycles terrestrial happenings physical things seen experienced two eyes whilst two feet stood ground
learn interpret physical terrestrial happenings merely observe lead us better understand celestial relating divine
physical aspects earth universe move patterns cycles safely assumed grand force powering cycles divine moves way
therefore observe seasons beyond literal baseline interpretation find symbolize concept life deathfall representing death
seems odd beautiful time year would represent something sad unfortunate death exactly point
lively shades red orange yellow intended show us extraordinary beauty ending life
take idea see spring represents rebirth winter summer represent space
inevitable falling leaves death also inevitable growth life
life death cycle like seasons quite magnificent process
remember conversation good pal dave
looking window high school english classroom watching brown leaves swirling around heavy breeze
mutually agreed fall best season windy everything dying trippy lot beauty found physical since turned observations interpretations discovered whole new passion nature workings universe
spent lot time studying nature connection divine believe greater significance things observe first five senses
intend discover natural processes teach us think everyone
next time see something beautiful ask mean summer last waltz shadow cast upon ground stretched unto north today field grass gold crown soon cut bailed hay cotton leavesthey fall like rain drip valley stream although years quite seems special gleam pines watch branches clear wait face wind snow needles forest seer show sleepy grow fall showers apple orchard breeze ripe rotting cider sent dangling leaves fire tossed soft air rain like dancing feathers pumpkin patches stacked like spit winter wood harvest stands farm fresh food stretch along winding country road fallen acorns crushed skipped upon gravel shoulder leaves waltz last tumbling steps across gravestone pavement palette first quarry last swim yellow green leaves gentle orange brush strokes gods deep green pool marble walls floating reverie shy italian eyes sun hot long strokes may last season harvest moon orange moon crested atlantic like morning sun full faced orange globe smoldered like campfire coals true colors still shy camera eyes adjust better lenses fiery round face slowly smothered rose light bone gray like ash flame sucked light stars sparkle radiates rainbow ring 09 14 2017 david j debonis morning pulled truck stop interstate 90 6 morning
generally like get road 5am rhyme reason simply always morning person dawn gives certain rush
maybe triggers subconscious years spent skiing mountain climbing weekends
anyway went wash hands bathroom looked mirror hardly recognized crazed mad man looking back
starters showered two weeks desperate need shave
hair knotted static jetting every direction
burning passionate eyes unmistakeable
snap shotted image mind hopped back road
arose another extended stay woods spent days reading writing shade
whilst alone man gets thinking much gets tired thinking
spent lot time contemplating want take experiences want put page
lot learned journey like think discoveries limited head
sharing experiences others never allow truly understand grand adventure embarked sure hell show much learned maybe motivate go expedition
remember couple years back old hunting buddy john told david experience way really learn
could read book shit day said skinned hide freshly killed doe would never know actually line resonated
love read lot learned books mentors way really know something experience firsthand
reminds jack kerouac quote goes experience best teacher someone else distorted point view although writing teachers guide us write direction give us inspiration learning always told perspective
therefore must see world eyes order understand
discredit importance writing reading though
sharing stories always vitality human condition written language man greatest creationfar better sliced bread
although something sacred verbally sharing stories generation generation much like native americans done culture stories dissipate people
credit knowledge human history people wrote experience world stories later read interpreted shared
writing truly beautiful thing one many reasons calling passion
matter life takes know write day die
sat thinking deerlodge national forest occurred winter first toe poked way montana mountains
dew dawn turned frost hands tough skin begin crack along scarred knuckles
lips chapped large gusts wind blow north speaking hills carrying clouds
days still burning hot september afternoons early morning air frigid hesitate leave cozy insulated mummy bag
sat shade noble pines listened elk bugle hillside warning one another men bows
fresh forest air drifted woods slightly damp full life
scent mix pine earth aroma one pulls large chunk mossy dirt ground
reading one ten books rambling along page took long walks fished crick
bed rocks edged small stream water flowed
half trees roots stretched eroded dry bank dangling rock bed like vines
rocks beneath clear water coated brown algae moss danced smooth current
casted line tiny beaver dam reservoir hoping catch one little pan friers darted cracks coves shallow water
lost lure caught nothing seen coming could drop line
imagined camouflaged fish watching shiny spinner suspicious pink powerbait glared refracted figure dark crevice
yet catch anything trip far found ideal spot
conclude thinking writing ever really hope turn ideas experiences something people enjoy learn
way see right amount coffee anything possible
dear jack dave already know whole backstory theres use typing biography
figure starte story day left day saw last
guess catching beings
kurt vonnegut said write please one person
open window make love world speak story get pneumonia wanted chose one write tory please way could pick two
best friends brothers soul mates want express gratitude existence form story
chapter one holy fucking shit
think better way begin describe much happened since left home august go
hope hooked
could spend days days typing biography trying describe happened life made person needed become order embark journey
could talk family life place grew people grew
could ramble youthful adventures adolecent dumbass ary day long truth people actually going read already know enough things
happen stumbled across know things say learn lot somebody writing
monday august 7th day eighth full moon
rose sun grateful dead jamming eyes world swing audutorium 1977
jumped bed without considering would last time slept comfortably long time began dance across bedroom floor spirited step
revitalized
escape day months grinding 50 hours week 5200 feet sun blaring burnt red forearms finally going pay
gathered last things bedroom took one last look across messy space embodied coming age
tapestries draped knuckle holes drywall quotes sticky notes pinned beside pictures post cards cluttered desk stacks papers books
shut light closed door turned back childhood hallway
walked stairs heard something drop bounce along hardwood ting ting ting
hands full dropped bags van checked stairwell returned inside
surprise found saint christopher medal grandmother given sold first car years
small silver gray medal hook meant hang visor car
medal depicted boat plane car read saint christopher protect us seen since sold volkswagen afford van magically appeared feet left home
hung visor coffee brewed
first many odd allignments strange occurances would encounter along journey
said farewell parents dog lola dim gray morning light
mom handed coffee travel mug began pressing motherly questions asking since started camping 10
first aid kit
pair tweezers
need anything else go said got
always prepared like boy scout know
anyway need anything else always buy along way know know
trying save much money
going need miss guys said hugged bill
turned hop van warming curb bill yelled godspeed ponyboy laughed put van drive honked horn three times took west towards rocky mountain horizon
continue think clarify something
van speak high top 1997 gmc safari painted maroon silver gray stripes straight 90
first glance really tell make looks like aerodynamic space cruiser rammed many comets
whole van dented dinged dirt coated stitched least rolls duct tape
paint chipped peeled faded hood roof entire front end splattered thousands bugs like highway roadkill
sits meaty set baja champion tires make wonder dune buggy standing cinder blocks right
ordinary van driving vail 70 familiar made drive hundreds times childhood go skiing hiking camping
van climbed high mountain passes head wandered cloudy overcast skies
odd completely alone idea would home
sipped coffee prevent tired eyes drifting road
prom night senior year ditched dance dinner instead went aquarium two good friends
point graduate high school still quite unclear plans post graduation
felt conflicted longed live life adventure freedom simultaneously system consequences left standing metaphorical minefield
stood thick aquarium glass watching fish float around turned said imagine would feel like spend entire life tiny aquarium
pondered idea said guess travel
moment occurred different aquarium bound fish
aquarium merely symbol way many us humans lead lives
become bonded responsibilities jobs payments glass obligation slowly builds completely boxed drowning stale water piss
suddenly realize fish stuck aquarium denver nearest ocean thousand miles away
day decided would everything power trapped like fish instead roam freely endless rivers open sea
get wrong love hometown way raised
grew denver colorado exploring rocky mountains beauty
decided dream life away instead make dreams reality
everyone capable shaping path lives matter mindset willing dreams happen regardless possible consequences
taken road
since remember deep longing exploration learning adventure
eight years old wanted indiana jones much changed since
spent youth embracing action adventure wherever could find climbing camping rocky mountains driving endlessly night city
felt glass walls closing wanted see could learn world late
seeing world grants perspective experience teaches connection share universe around
writer three things vital confronting page
hope enjoy reading adventures much enjoy writing
thank reading
08 30 2017 david j debonis things quite busy since arrived san francisco
busy sense rushing place place trying get things done instead implying time occupied visiting people places
therefore left little time report reflect upon travels
traveler time much differently experienced routine time people experience
associate things day week instead many days passed since said thing happened
without set schedule reason keep track calendar
also found referencing clock much less often used
tried get habit going sleep tired eating hungry
unstructured simplicity liberating
allows conscious body world around opposed measurement time
specifically record date journal entry make organization help referencing later
anyway san francisco beautiful city seen besides denver course
along roads second third story bay windows jet narrow city streets
houses tall thin built directly one another
beautiful assortment architecture tie dyed colorful humble paints
streets roll giant hills like tracks roller coaster
generally try take easy driving john denver old carries heavy load
something feels natural cruising neighborhoods lead foot
sometimes hills steep nose pointed straight sky fly hoping might get launched right heavens
first stop san francisco coffee cafe trieste haight ashbury
seems cross streets reactor center counterculture movement happened arrive exactly 50 years summer love
first went 710 asbury house grateful dead lived beginning career
refurbished house street haight
large tree canopies front steps
carved trunk hundreds names initials dead lyrics
sidewalk beside small paintings jerry pigpen someone obviously made attempt scratching fade away
ashbury famous sign corner intersection
clock jets building hands clock never move 4 20
haight giant mural burger joint reads summer love 1967 features paintings core members dead
went hung around golden gate park giant wise trees umbrella huge park
energy radiating pallet greens yet first yellow leaves fall scattered dark asphalt
could hear sound children playing laughing screaming distant playset felt sense youthful innocence
wrote journal summer 1967 may gone love still much spent day long boarding across park meeting people along way
spent days touring san franciscothe coast beat museum chinatown etc
soon pressured city difficult find overnight parking
despite know san francisco place returning
since two generous hosts family friend chi north bay sister maddie school oregon
road traveler staying friends family experiencing many different types life

sometimes calls sometimes dread thought
regardless way life incomparable anything ever experienced
going hop back oregon trail head towards wilderness beyond
hope return liberated bodhisattva
unfortunately difficult record experiences vivid detail blog
therefore pick choose details mention
many stories told
feel free message questions
08 21 2017 david j debonis today day solar eclipse
sat small san francisco espresso shop called coffee trieste americano notebook
cloudy bay area today wonder cosmic happenings may occur solunar rarity
quite adventure since leaving san diego last week
came flying los angeles friday morning hung around city evening time
let tell john van built city streets
cruises highways sensual grip road big ol purple safari bus tackles road trails would imagine
comes fast paced rush hour traffic city ride ends feeling like busted carnival ride
mean thing 1997 house wheels tiny hybrid smart phone car runs rice vanilla lattes
come flying interstate goin 80 suddenly whole convoy comes dead stop
slam brakes debating need jam e brake make sure destroy toyota corolla stopped dime ahead
sudden deep city bouncing across cracked asphalt jamming breaks aggressively accelerating jetting across lanes making turns really push limits gravity center high top
water bottles cups pans hung across back rattling like set wind chimes hurricane cursing way around horribly parked cars angry 9 5ers idea going
mention right rearview mirror broken thanks colin curtains closed windows hardly tell going around time anyway
often times go hope best
strategy works often different discussion
anyway finally reached cutty house close family friend nearly took high top clear van tried park complex parking garage clearance 6inches shorter van roof
found spot finally found relief city stresses
went inside played game darts went sleep
next day helped volunteer kids lacrosse clinic compton went venice beach afternoon
enjoyed ocean sunshine left red boiled lobster per usual
wrap night stay los angeles went cook friends house showed ad agency seemed awesome place work
headed north pch next morning
eventually trailed pch road got distracted following signs read san francisco xxx miles suddenly cruising rolling hills golden brown grass
scattered vineyards orchards lay across countryside countless rows grapevines fruit trees crawling valley hilltop
suddenly entered salinas valley perfectly resembled steinbeck description east eden besides population difference
long dry mountains either side fell wide valley ranches farms
decided stop salinas night town john steinbeck grew
checked steinbeck national museum learned steinbeck took road trip similar one embarked
alone truck bed fit camper steinbeck dog charlie took find america lost touch
knew ten twelve thousand miles driving truck alone would hard work represented antidote poison professional sick man said steinbeck
inspired greatly steinbeck one time favorite fiction authors
also helped analyze search expedition
jetted salinas early next morning cruised rest valley dark distant silhouette mountains across cloudy night sky
half awake daze sleepy eyes passed garlic farm
fresh distinguished aroma floated air reminded early morning gravy sunday stove
although loving road say times find missing home
living road quite experience
crazy one day could completely unoccupied hanging around nothing jotting ideas sitting thinking next day could jam packed adventures people partying
never really know road store
brings next point road helped tremendously staying touch present moment
idea tomorrow know sleeping tonight okay know matters
carpe diem stress rest friends
08 17 2017 david j debonis van dwelling way life people across country world taken large variety reasons
many people enjoy freedom ability live wherever one drive given time
others chose live van order save money would spending ever rising rent prices especially major cities
people end living van option leftaside living streets
van living become culture demographics
truth matter situation van living considered homelessness
since arriving california met many people eyes city would considered homeless whether hitchhiker passing group people living motorhome near beach someone sleeps pier homeless population california often frowned upon shunned community
left las vegas late sunday night jetted straight california aching heart
real reason chose take 5 hour trek depths night avoid spend another day burning way mojave desert
put pink floyd dark side moon took interstate 15
despite absence sun still managed break sweat drive
air cool much mojave night
arrived ocean beach early morning carefully selected parking spot along fence line half mile ocean conscious street sweeping signs
closed curtains took beach
arrived back van late afternoon paper sign pasted window blue painters tape read overnight parking call police stuck sign back nearest fence post immediately took
although overnight parking spot would legal accordance city street signs already aware sleeping vehicle illegal cities considered vagrancy
settled night place called fiesta island peninsula park jets mission bay
although signs entrance read vehicles 10 00pm 4 00am heard locals van dwelling forms area rarely patrolled inhabited community recreational vehicles nightly basis
pulled sand along west side bay 20 feet water parked night
night perfect
sat upon banks fishing rod cast line water savoring buzz banquets brought colorado saved moment
finally made california thought ripples broke across sand soft melody
began think jim harrison poem drinking song reflected upon journey far
little later met david neighbor camper also staying island night talked
met two mexican brothers named mario jose area
offered couple modelos happily accepted talked fire park closed took
finally settled van night put live dead speaker
cool ocean breeze flowed van door extraordinarily relieved finally broke late summer pit fire stretches western slopes rockies
fell deep sleep shaken next morning
reason believe relaxing sleep southern california next night fiesta island awoken police 2am booted island
complaining relieved get ticket vagrancy trespassing
hardly slept 4am finally decided get move day
last night decided would take different strategy
hung around sunset cliffs beachtaking pictures sunset hanging around van park closed 10pm
point drove blocks spot selected earlier quickly parked jumped curtains blacked bedroom back van
lied set alarm 4 45am planning leave spot got ready sleep
five minutes parked flashlight shining windows van trying see blinds
grabbing water time stood still sculpture finally sensed presence left
immediately hopped back drivers seat took
ended breaking sleep three different 2 3 hour sections order avoid breaking parking laws still
although ideal situation understand something signed part journey
seen large amount enforcement distaste towards homelessness san diego
truth although van dwellers may considered homeless vehicles homes reason many people streets
chose pay rent wealthy property owners mean right inhabit homes
know solution sure hell beginning think one
although vagrancy laws may keep streets clean also preventing many people place sleep
people city could come compromise sure middle ground could found
new found compassion homeless population beginning understand feels ostracized majority society
receive lot funny looks whether scruffy unshaved face brushing teeth sidewalk getting bedroom wheels
beginning enjoy
currently homeless lonesome traveler passing city city
worth experiencing side society first hand never would understood stayed within walls fish tank
